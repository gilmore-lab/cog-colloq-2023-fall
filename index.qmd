- Psychology a science of *behavior* and *internal experience* (perception, cognition, emotion...)
- What is the logical, *physical* status ($\Phi$) of psychological states ($\Psi$)?

### Crisis #2d: Generalizability

>...The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that **failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems** (e.g., the replication crisis)

## Motivation

- Sex^[Our study: "What was the sex you were assigned at birth?"] differences ($M>F$) in vision [@Shaqiri2018-ys]: especially contrast sensitivity [@Abramov2012-da], motion sensitivity [@Murray2018-vn; @Qian2021-eu].
- Sex differences spatial cognition (e.g., mental rotation) and activity choices.
- Do these replicate?
- Do they relate to one another?

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}

- Replications are good
    - And sadly uncommon
    - Bigger (combined) samples $\rightarrow$ higher power to detect smaller effects
    - Don't we want to know the distribution of effect sizes | manipulations X, Y, Z?

:::

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Data sharing is good
    - Didn't ask original authors for data, but shouldn't have to.
    - Most authors don't share even when asked [@Watson2022-ox; @Gabelica2022-nt; @Tedersoo2021-ad; @Vanpaemel2015-zr; @Wicherts2006-de] **even by a journal editor!** [@Miyakawa2020-wu].
    - Wrote (new) code for both vision tasks (and shared it).
:::

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Preregistration helps draw bright line between *confirmatory* and *exploratory* analyses
    - Hard, but useful discipline
    - Included several post-registration exploratory analyses, including one suggested by reviewer.
    - "Causal" analysis: Vision better predictor of mental rotation scores than sex.
:::

## Lessons learned

- [Power *curve* analyses](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/sex-differences-project/analysis/preregistration/preregistration_power_analysis.html) (different $n$'s, effect sizes) especially informative and useful.

![Power analysis curves from [@Qian2022-yp]](include/img/qian-berenbaum-gilmore-power-plot.png){fig-align="center"}

---

- Don't fully understand relationship between sample size, power, and effect size? 
    - See [this exercise](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-fall/ex05-apes.html) and [this app](https://rogilmore.shinyapps.io/PSYCH490-2023-APES/).
    
## Lessons learned
    
- We need bigger samples...
    
>...Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, **false report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole (psychology and cognitive neuroscience) literature**. [@Szucs2017-fc]

## Lessons learned

::: {.incremental}
- Internally reproducible workflows
    - Bolster confidence ("don't fool yourself")
    - Easier to share with collaborators, the world
    - Always in a "share-able" form
    - Especially scriptable figures!

- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) & [Quarto](https://quarto.org) especially powerful tools for 'literate programming' [@knuth_undated-mi; @Knuth1984-ot] : combining text, links, images, code, analyses into HTML, PDF, .docx, .pptx, documents or websites.
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) also great; see Mike Burhnam's workshop at the [Open Science Bootcamp](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023/day_2.html#day_2_pm_session_4).

## Lessons learned

- Plot (all of) your data
- And save the plots, so you can use them later

## "Good enough" open science practices

- Dr. Alaina Pearce, Open Science Bootcamp | [talk slides](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023/pdf/2023_OpenScienceBootcamp-GoodEnough.pdf)
- "Good enough" ==
    - (relatively) low effort
    - shallow learning curve
    - beneficial to current and future you 
    - increases ‘openness’ of research
    
---

- Preserve raw data
    - Avoid manual manipulations
- Create a central project hub
- Use (consistent) meaningful names
- Preserve the journey (use version control)
- Tidy your data (longer vs. wider)
- Document your data (Metadata magic)

## Gilmore's additions...

- Replicate and/or simulate
- Visualize early and often
- Preregister
- Embed frequent quality assurance checks into your workflows
- Distribute 'curation' burden throughout the project

## Idea

- What if *all* first year projects were pre-registered replication studies with open materials, and were documented via a preprint published on [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com)?
- What if the PSYCH 100 participant pool data were permissioned and available for research beyond lab-specific screening?

## Open science practices need not be all or none

- Greater openness $\rightarrow$ closer match between idealistic values and practical concerns
- "Good enough" is still good

## What about the *other* crises?

::: {.incremental}
- Psychological laws
    - Fitts Law: Speed/accuracy trade-offs undermine rigor (quantity vs. quality)
    - Cognitive biases: Undermine rationality (including scientific inference); Must be guarded-against, see [@munafo_manifesto_2017]
- Construct validity
    - Need more, better, widely shared documentation about what was asked/measured, by whom, in what context...

- The one about the logical, physical status of psychological states
    - $\Phi\leftarrow\Psi$
    - Progress--I'm less confused than before--but that's another talk...
    - Everyone has a model; what's yours?
